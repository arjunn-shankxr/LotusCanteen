# LotusCanteen
**LotusCanteen** is a revolutionary idea that saves tons of time while getting the delicious food we crave. Built for the usage of the students and faculty of DSCE, this web application is aimed to reduce the painful task of standing in a queue and ordering food. Using our application, people can now directly order food from their mobile phones and pay using facilities such as PhonePe or GooglePay. Then, a bill is generated after a successful payment and can be shown at the counter. This minimises time by about 90% while still getting our favourite food.
